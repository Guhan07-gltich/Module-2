# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a=int(input())
z=bin(a)
print(z)
```

## Output
![438596169-6cdcbdd7-614c-457e-9863-c96ba9705fa9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27cce1d0-d1eb-49ec-948a-a4e4ec49e1d6)

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully
